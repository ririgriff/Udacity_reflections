What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It adds a .git directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It allows us to define the files that should be included together as one commit before it is committed 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only put things in it at any one time that belong together in a single commit
